	<p>Dogs are better house pets than cats. Dogs are known as "Mans Best Friend" and are there to protect the home they live in, they care for their owners and are hardly violent towards you. If there was an intruder they would protect the home with their life, cats hardly do anything. They just hide in imposible places to find them and they are usually violent towards their owners for no reason.</p>
	<br>
	<p>dogs are able to hear 4 times as far as humans a dog's sense of smell is about 1,000 to 10,000,000 times better than a regular humans smell. There are more than 150 dog breeds, divided into 8 categories: sporting, hound, working, terier, toy, non-sporting, herding, and miscellaneous.</p>
